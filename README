Announcing Fur Affinity: Project Phoenix

Fur Affinity is happy to announce that the next version of furaffinity.net is in active development. Our goal is simple, to provide you with a better experience that can be sustained and improved upon for years to come. 

To reach this goal, we will be rewriting Fur Affinity from the ground up. Codenamed Project Phoenix, we’re able to take full advantage of new technologies that have emerged since Fur Affinity's birth, ensuring the site is easily maintained and extended upon for years to come.

We’re also working on a visual refresh, improving the overall look and feel, as well as the user experience. We’ll be holding our design to a higher standard to ensure that Fur Affinity provides ease of use while retaining high visual appeal.
